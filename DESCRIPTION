Description: This package is based on the qBase algorithms published by
 Hellemans et al. in 2007. The EasyqpcR package allows you to import easily qPCR
 data files as described in the vignette. Thereafter, you can calculate
 amplification efficiencies, relative quantities and their standard errors,
 normalization factors based on the best reference genes choosen (using the
 SLqPCR package), and then the normalized relative quantities, the NRQs scaled
 to your control and their standard errors. This package has been created for
 low-throughput qPCR data analysis.
Imports: plyr, matrixStats, plotrix, gWidgetsRGtk2
Suggests: SLqPCR, qpcrNorm, qpcR, knitr
biocViews: qPCR, GeneExpression
